        This platform is built to support students in tertiary institutions, especially teacher trainees, with their academic project work â€” focusing on <strong class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">Action Research</strong>, the kind of research meant for solving classroom-based problems.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 text-base leading-relaxed">
        We provide free access to completed Action Research projects and aim to help users understand how to conduct theirs by learning from real examples submitted by others.

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 text-base leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">Our future plan</strong> is to make this platform a growing hub where teacher trainees can not only find guidance but also contribute their research work. This will create a valuable and free resource bank for anyone seeking to understand how classroom-based research is done.
